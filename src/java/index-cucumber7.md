# Cucumber 7

Cucumber is a testing library that allows you to write your tests in plain language. It follows the given-when-then structure, but as you'll see the tests are very readable. Even by business users. This allows your tests to be a point of communication and collaboration.

With our Cucumber reporters you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API endpoints.
