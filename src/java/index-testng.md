# TestNG

TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language created by CÃ©dric Beust and inspired by JUnit and NUnit. The design goal of TestNG is to cover a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc., with more powerful and easy-to-use functionalities.

With our TestNG reporter, you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API endpoints.
