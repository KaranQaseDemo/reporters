# Playwright

**Playwright** is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is evergreen, capable, reliable, and fast.

With the `playwright-qase-reporter`, you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API.
