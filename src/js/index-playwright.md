# Playwright

**Playwright** is an open-source automation framework for testing web applications across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).

It enables end-to-end testing, browser automation, and web scraping with a single API, supporting actions like navigating pages and interacting with UI elements.

Our `playwright-qase-reporter` allows you to upload the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project via the Qase's public API.
