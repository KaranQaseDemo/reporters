# WebDriverIO

WebdriverIO is an open-source testing framework for automating web applications using JavaScript or TypeScript. Built on the WebDriver protocol, it offers a simple API and supports various test frameworks like Mocha and Cucumber.

With the `wdio-qase-reporter` you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API.
