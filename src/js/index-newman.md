# Newman

Newman is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman. It enables you to run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line. It's built with extensibility in mind so that you can integrate it with your continuous integration (CI) servers and build systems.

With the `newman-reporter-qase` you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API.
