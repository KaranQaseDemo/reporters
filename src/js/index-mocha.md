# Mocha

Mocha is a powerful and flexible JavaScript testing framework that runs on Node.js and in the browser, making it suitable for testing both server-side and client-side applications. It supports various assertion libraries, allowing developers to write tests in a style that suits their preferences.

With the `mocha-qase-reporter` you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API.
