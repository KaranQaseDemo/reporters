# CucumberJS

CucumberJS is a tool that runs automated tests written in plain language, making them easy for anyone on your team to understand. This accessibility promotes better communication, enhances collaboration, and builds trust within the team.

With the `cucumberjs-qase-reporter` you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API.
