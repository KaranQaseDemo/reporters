# Installation

To integrate Qase Reporter in your Playwright setup, follow these steps:



### Activate the Playwright App

To activate the app, go to the [Apps](https://app.qase.io/apps?app=playwright-reporter) section in your workspace, and click on 'Activate'.

Switch to the 'Access tokens' tab, and create a new API token from here. Save the API token as we'll need it for the next steps.



### add playwright-qase-reporter to your project

To install and add the reporter as a development dependency, run the following command in your node project [^yarn]:

```bash
npm install -D playwright-qase-reporter
```



### add the reporter to your playwright configuration file

At the very least, the reporter will need two variables defined â€” your playwright app's token, and the Qase project you want to publish the results to:
<br>

```typescript
// file: playwright.config.ts
//
{{#include ../code/playwright/playwright.config.ts}}
```

Please refer to [*this article*](https://help.qase.io/en/articles/9787250-how-do-i-find-my-project-code) for guidance on how to find your Project code in Qase.
<br>

You can configure the reporter options in a separate file `qase.config.json`, placed in the *root directory of your project*.
```json
{{#include ../../intro/code/qase.config.json:basic}} 

```



### Let's verify the integration

We'll use a simple test to check if the results are being published to your Qase project. Create a `tests/` directory in the root of your project and add the following test:

```javascript
{{#include ../code/playwright/example.spec.js}}
```
<br>



**Now, let's run the test** by executing the following command:

```bash
QASE_MODE=testops npx playwright test
```

In the above command, we're setting the reporter's mode to 'testops' using the environment variable `QASE_MODE`.

Click on the link printed at the end of the run to go to the test run in Qase.

[^yarn]: If you are using `yarn` as your package manager, please run `yarn add playwright-qase-reporter -D` to install the reporter, and `yarn playwright test` to run the tests.
