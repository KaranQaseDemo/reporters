# Installation

To integrate Qase Reporter in your WebdriverIO setup, follow these steps:

### Activate the WebdriverIO App
To activate the app, go to the [Apps](https://app.qase.io/apps?app=wdio-reporter) section in your workspace, and click on 'Activate'

Switch to the 'Access tokens' tab, and create a new API token from here. Save the API token as we'll need it for the next steps.

### Install `wdio`
Run `npm init wdio@latest .` to create a project in the current directory, and we'll choose the following configuration for the purpose of this guide.

*Configuration*

### Add `wdio-qase-reporter` to your project
To install and add the reporter as a development dependency, run the following in node project:

```bash
npm install -D wdio-qase-reporter@beta
```

### Add the reporter to your configuration file
`wdio.conf.ts`:

```typescript
import WDIOQaseReporter from 'wdio-qase-reporter';
import type { Options } from '@wdio/types';
import { afterRunHook, beforeRunHook } from 'wdio-qase-reporter';

export const config: Options.Testrunner = {
  reporters: [
    [
      WDIOQaseReporter, 
      {
        disableWebdriverStepsReporting: true,
        disableWebdriverScreenshotsReporting: true,
        useCucumber: false,
      }
    ]
  ],

  // ...
  // =====
  // Hooks
  // =====
  onPrepare: async function() {
    await beforeRunHook();
  },
  onComplete: async function() {
    await afterRunHook();
  },

  // ... other options
};
```

Additional options to configure in the `wdio.conf.ts` file:

- `disableWebdriverStepsReporting`
  - Default: `false`
  - to not log custom steps to the reporter.
- `disableWebdriverScreenshotsReporting`
  - Default: `false`
  - do not attach screenshots to the reporter.
- `useCucumber`
  - Default: `false`
  - if you use Cucumber, enable this option.

At the very least, the reporter will need two variables defined - your WebdriverIO App's Token, and the Qase Project code you want to publish your results to.

We will create a new file `qase.config.json` at the root of your project to add these values.

`qase.config.json`:

```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "testops": {
    "api": {
      "token": "<app-token>"
    },
    "project": "<project-code>",
    "run": {
      "complete": true
    }
  }
} 
```

Please refer to this article for guidance on how to find your Project code in Qase.

## Verify the integration
We'll use the autogenerated login tests to check if the results are being published to your Qase project.

Let's run the test, by executing the following command:

```bash
QASE_MODE=testops npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.ts
```

In the above command, we're setting the reporter's mode to 'testops' using the Environment variable `QASE_MODE`.
