# Cypress

**Cypress** is a purely JavaScript-based front-end testing tool built for the modern web. It aims to address the pain points developers or QA engineers face while testing an application. Cypress is a more developer-friendly tool that uses a unique DOM manipulation technique and operates directly in the browser.

With the `cypress-qase-reporter`, you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API.
