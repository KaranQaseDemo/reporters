# Jest

Jest is a powerful JavaScript testing framework developed by Meta, known for its ease of use and zero-config setup. It works well with any JavaScript project, especially React, and includes features like built-in assertions, snapshot testing, and mocking.

Jest runs tests in parallel for faster execution and automatically generates code coverage reports.

With the `jest-qase-reporter` you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API.
