# Pytest

Pytest is a Python testing framework that originated from the PyPy project. It can be used to write various types of software tests, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and functional tests. Its features include parametrized testing, fixtures, and assert re-writing.

With `qase-pytest` you can publish the results of your automated test runs to your Qase project using the public API.
